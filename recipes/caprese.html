        <li>Olives (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First slice tomatoes to your desired thickness, I prefer thicker slices that are comparable in size to the
            mozzerella slices.</li>
        <li>Next, chiffonade basil.</li>
        <li>If mozzerella is not pre-cut, then slice mozzerella to desired thickness.</li>
        <li>On a platter or shallow serving dish, lay out the sliced tomoatoes and mozzerella, alternating them to
            create a pattern.</li>
        <li>Now, toss course salt over the top of the sliced tomatoes and mozz. Make sure to add enough to have each
            piece with salt.</li>
        <li>Next, evenly spread the chiffonade basil across the slices and make sure it is evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Lastly, drizzle lightly with balsalmic vinegar and EVOO. If using balsalmic glaze, first drizzle with EVOO,
            then apply glaze in long lines across the tiop to create a beautiful pattern.</li>
        <li>Enjoy as is or with crachers of your choosing.</li>
    </ol>
